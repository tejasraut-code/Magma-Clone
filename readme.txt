🔗 Magma Website Clone – Frontend Development Project - UI 

🚀 I built a fully responsive and animated clone of the Magma website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the modern Web3-based real estate platform, focusing on immersive visuals and smooth user interactions.

	> Scroll-triggered animations and seamless transitions
	> Visually engaging, responsive layout with modern design
	> Basic implementation of HTML canvas using JavaScript for visual effects

🛠️ Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, Locomotive Scroll, Canvas (JS)

🎯 This project helped me improve my front-end development skills, particularly in animation workflows, scroll effects, and responsive design.
